# GPT From Scratch

This project is an implementation of a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model built entirely from scratch, inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's "Let's Build GPT from Scratch" tutorial](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY).

## Objective

The goal is to deeply understand the inner workings of GPT models by building one step-by-step, without relying on high-level machine learning frameworks.

## Credits

Special thanks to [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy) for his excellent tutorial and educational resources, which serve as the foundation for this project.
